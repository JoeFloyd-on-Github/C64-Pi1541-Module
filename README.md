OK, so the new and shiny SD2IEC wasn't all you wanted from a lowcost floppy
emulation solution. Sure, there are other good solutions out there for those
willing and able to put a lot of money into the FPGA-based ones - personally
I can afford it, but I don't want my other retro computers to think I'm biased
towards the Commodore 64 so options were needed and fast... afterall, you have
to spend that money before it get's spent on something else instead.

Thankfully, some enterprising folks have taken it upon themselves to create a
solution based on the Raspberry Pi and with some extra modifications we all can
build one. Personally I prefer clean and nice PCBs over hacked together stuff,
so away I went to make one in KiCAD.
